# USAII Intuitive LMS 5.2

Written in US English. The official USAII logo is `public/usaii-logo.png`.

A learning platform built on the CEO's vision: every learner always knows **where they are, what to do next, and how to improve**, with nothing extra in the way.

## Start it (Windows)

1. Install **Node.js 20 or newer** from https://nodejs.org (the LTS button). You only do this once.
2. Unzip this folder (right-click → **Extract All…**).
3. Open the extracted folder and double-click **`START.bat`**.

The first start installs packages (1–3 minutes, internet needed). The browser then opens by itself on the sign-in page, normally at **http://localhost:4600**. Keep the black window open while you use the LMS; close it to stop.

> **Seeing an old version?** Older prototypes run on port 3000. This LMS uses its own port (4600) and moves to the next free port if that one is busy; the window shows the exact address. The browser tab says **USAII Intuitive LMS 5.2**.

macOS or Linux: run `./start.sh` in a terminal.

## Sign in

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Learner | alex.rivera@enterprise.com | `Learner@2026` |
| Instructor | instructor@usaii.org | `Instructor@2026` |

- **Other learners:** the learner password also works for `jordan.lee@enterprise.com` (sees the first-time goal setup) and `morgan.chen@enterprise.com`.
- **Two roles only:** learners take courses; instructors create, publish, and track them. There is no administrator role and no self sign-up. Instructors create learner accounts and set each learner's password.

## Learner

The menu is **My Dashboard, Learning, Progress, Explore Courses, Steps to Completion, Your Journey, Ask**, then **Give Feedback, Quick Tools, Milestone Vault**.

- **My Dashboard:** one next step, how you are doing, your study habits, what to improve, and a planner.
- **Learning:** every lesson in order. **About this course** has two buttons side by side: **View Study Guide** opens the whole guide inside the LMS as a formatted Markdown document, starting at the lesson you are on; **Download Study Guide (PDF)** keeps a copy.
- **Lessons** follow one path: Learn → Check → Apply → Reflect → Complete.
- **Progress:** your learning metrics, understanding by topic, quiz scores, and study time.
- **Steps to Completion** (per course):
  - **In the sidebar:** a collapsible list of every step with a checkmark as each one is finished and a "3/10" badge. It opens by itself on learning pages and remembers if you close it.
  - **As a page:** exactly how to earn the certificate. Three rules, then one animated path with every step. Each step lists what it takes (work through the lesson, take the check, submit the activity, mark it complete) with a **Go** button for anything left. The top shows steps left, time left, and your projected finish date.
- **Your Journey** (per course): a simple, dated record of what you have done, newest first.
  - **Filter bar:** choose the course, then see **Days in this course** and **Time invested**.
  - **Filters:** All, Lessons, Activities, Feedback on activities.
  - **Each entry:** a lesson you completed (with time spent), an activity you submitted (**Read** opens it), your instructor's decision on it (Approved, Resubmission requested, or Not approved, with their note and **Revise and resubmit** when needed), the final assessment, and your certificate.
  - **Download my work (PDF):** everything you wrote in the course's activities, in one document.
  - Built automatically from the course as the instructor set it up, so it works for every course with no extra setup.
- **Give Feedback:** star ratings for the course and the LMS, and "Would you recommend USAII® to others?"

## Instructor

The menu is **Cohort, Learners & Access, Assessments, Activity Metrics, Questions**, then **My Courses**. Instructors manage the courses they created.

- **Cohort:** totals, then one row per learner with expected completion, predicted score, and actions (View portal, Guidance, Message).
- **Learners & Access:** add learners with a password, give or remove course access, and set new passwords.
- **Assessments:** three tabs.
  - **Activity submissions** (first tab): filter by course (or all your courses), by status (Awaiting review, Approved, Resubmission requested, Not approved), and by learner name. Each row shows only the learner, course, and assessment submitted. **View Assessment** opens the learner's work with three decisions: **Approve**, **Request resubmission**, or **Not approved**, plus **Feedback on activity**. A note is needed for the last two. The learner is notified at once, and a resubmission comes back as "Awaiting review", with the earlier review kept for context.
  - **Checks and quizzes:** percent correct per question.
  - **Final assessment:** attempts and results.
- **Activity Metrics:**
  - Active learners and learning hours this week.
  - **Where learners are on Steps to Completion:** how many learners are on each step, plus who has not moved in 7 days.
  - **Study Guide and learners' work:** who opened the Study Guide in the LMS, PDF downloads, and downloads of learners' own work.
  - **Learner feedback:** "would recommend USAII®", course and LMS ratings, and recent comments.
- **Questions:** learner questions, each private between that learner and the instructor.
- **My Courses:** create, edit, publish, and duplicate courses.

## Creating a course

Go to **My Courses → Create course**. There are three steps:

1. **Course details:** course name, one-line description, who can join, and pass mark.
2. **Lessons:** a simple list of lesson names. Press **Edit** on a lesson to open it. The **Add to this lesson** bar stays at the top while you scroll:
   - **Heading, Paragraph, List, Quote, Link, Note**
   - **Multimedia → Video, Audio, Image**, each with upload or paste a link (YouTube and Vimeo links play in the lesson)
   - Each lesson also has **Quiz questions** (practice or timed) and an optional **Activity** tab.
   - **Preview as learner** shows the lesson exactly as learners will see it.
3. **Final test (optional):** questions, time limit, and number of attempts.

Press **Save**, then **Publish**. Published courses appear under the learner's **Explore Courses**, and anyone you added can open them.

## Your data

- **Where it's stored:** everything is saved in `data/db.json`, and uploads are saved in `uploads/`. Both survive restarts.
- **Starting over:** double-click `RESET-DEMO-DATA.bat` while the LMS is stopped.
- **Upgrading from 4.9:** just start 5.0 on the same folder. Your data is kept; the administrator account, live sessions, and anything that only existed for them are removed automatically the first time it starts.

## Connecting a production backend

The screens talk to the server only through `/api/...` routes:

| Route | Used by |
|---|---|
| `/api/auth` | Sign-in, profile, password |
| `/api/learner` | Dashboard data, lessons, checks, activities, final test |
| `/api/staff` | Cohort, learners and access, assessments, activity, course builder |
| `/api/threads`, `/api/notifications`, `/api/feedback`, `/api/ai/tutor` | Community and support |
| `/api/uploads` | File uploads |

- **Database:** all data access goes through `server/db.ts`, so replacing the JSON file with PostgreSQL does not change any screen.
- **Analytics:** calculations live in one shared engine, `shared/analytics.ts`, and the data types are in `shared/types.ts`.

## Optional settings

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
- **`PORT`:** changes the starting port.
- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`:** lets the study coach write its own explanations, still limited to course material.

## For developers

```
npm install
npm run dev        # API + app on http://localhost:4600
npm run lint       # strict TypeScript check
npm run prod       # production build served by the same server
```
